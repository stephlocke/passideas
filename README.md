# PASS Ideas
Suggest, upvote, and see feedback on ideas for PASS
This is intended to provide a place that you can see past ideas, contribute new ones, and see feedback that has been provided from the BoD or HQ. Once a week we'll send a digest of the newest ideas on and then add feedback when we receive it.

> Ask PASS
> Want to know more about PASS? Would you like to share your ideas, comments or feedback?
> We want to hear from you! You can contact us directly or email the Director in charge of the PASS Portfolio relating to your question. We'll get back to you within 7 days.

**Go to [Issues](issues) to see ideas, react with a üëç to upvote answers, and see the feedback from PASS BoD**
